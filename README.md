# Console_Pacman (2018)
Terminal-based Pacman app. 

For my semester project, I have chosen the iconic game of Pac-Man and I aim to fulfill both standard requirements and those assigned by the project. This means:

Loading maps from a file - I plan to have 3 maps and the option to create your own
Scalable difficulty - easy, medium, hard with varying ghost intelligence
Standard objects - Pac-Man, ghosts, wall, coins, cherry, and bonus (ghost-eating)
Teleport
The game will be displayed entirely on the terminal without the use of ncurses.
